Upgrade my existing app "Kavid Plans".

The app currently:
- Saves sales
- Saves expenses
- Calculates totals

Now I want to add TWO major features:

========================================
PART 1 — DAILY FINANCIAL SUMMARY LOG
========================================

Add a new section called "Daily Financial Summary".

This section must automatically generate a daily record like this:

Example:
February 10, 2026
Total Sales: 100,000
Total Expenses: 20,000
Daily Profit / Balance: 80,000

Requirements:

1. Automatically calculate totals at the end of each day.
2. Group all sales and expenses by date.
3. For each date calculate:
   dailySales = sum of sales for that date
   dailyExpenses = sum of expenses for that date
   dailyBalance = dailySales - dailyExpenses
4. Store each daily summary in a separate table called:
   "daily_summaries"
5. Display summaries in a table format:
   Date | Total Sales | Total Expenses | Balance
6. Automatically update daily summary whenever a new sale or expense is added.
7. Use ISO timestamp format for accurate grouping.
8. Add filter options:
   - View by day
   - View by month
   - View by year

========================================
PART 2 — INVOICE SYSTEM (SEPARATE SECTION)
========================================

Create a new section in the app called:
"Invoice Management"

IMPORTANT:
The app remains in English.
BUT printed invoices must be in French language only.

INVOICE FEATURES:
----------------------------------------

1. Editable Company Information:
   - Company Name (editable)
   - Address (editable)
   - Phone Numbers (editable)
   - Logo upload option
2. Each invoice must automatically show at the top in bold and very visible:
   NO STATISTIQUE : 484788F
3. Invoice must include:
   - Invoice Number (auto generated)
   - Date (auto generated)
   - Time (if possible)
   - Client Name
   - Client Phone
   - Items table with:
       Description
       Quantity
       Unit Price
       Total
   - Automatic Grand Total calculation

----------------------------------------
VERY IMPORTANT:
----------------------------------------

When printing or exporting invoice:

All invoice content must appear in FRENCH language:

Examples:
- Facture
- Numéro de facture
- Date
